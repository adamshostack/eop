suits:
  Spoofing:
    2: An attacker could squat on the random port or socket that the server normally uses
    3: An attacker could try one credential after another and there's nothing to slow them down (online or offline)
    4: An attacker can anonymously connect, because we expect authentication to be done at a higher level
    5: An attacker can confuse a client because there are too many ways to identify a server
    6: An attacker can spoof a server because identifiers aren't stored on the client and checked for consistency on re-connection (that is, there's no key persistence)
    7: An attacker can connect to a server or peer over a link that isn't authenticated (and encrypted)
    8: An attacker could steal credentials stored on the server and reuse them (for example, a key is stored in a world readable file)
    9: An attacker who gets a password can reuse it (Use stronger authenticators)
    10: An attacker can choose to use weaker or no authentication
    J: An attacker could steal credentials stored on the client and reuse them
    Q: An attacker could go after the way credentials are updated or recovered (account recovery doesn't require disclosing the old password)
    K: Your system ships with a default admin password, and doesn't force a change
    A: You've invented a new Spoofing attack

  Tampering:
    3: An attacker can take advantage of your custom key exchange or integrity control which you built instead of using standard crypto
    4: Your code makes access control decisions all over the place, rather than with a security kernel
    5: An attacker can replay data without detection because your code doesn't provide timestamps or sequence numbers
    6: An attacker can write to a data store your code relies on
    7: An attacker can bypass permissions because you don't make names canonical before checking access permissions
    8: An attacker can manipulate data because there's no integrity protection for data on the network
    9: An attacker can provide or control state information
    10: An attacker can alter information in a data store because it has weak/open permissions or includes a group which is equivalent to everyone ("anyone with a Facebook account")
    J: An attacker can write to some resource because permissions are granted to the world or there are no ACLs
    Q: An attacker can change parameters over a trust boundary and after validation (for example, important parameters in a hidden field in HTML, or passing a pointer to critical memory)
    K: An attacker can load code inside your process via an extension point
    A: You've invented a new Tampering attack

  Repudiation:
    2: An attacker can pass data through the log to attack a log reader, and there's no documentation of what sorts of validation are done
    3: A low privilege attacker can read interesting security information in the logs 
    4: An attacker can alter digital signatures because the digital signature system you're implementing is weak, or uses MACs where it should use a signature
    5: An attacker can alter log messages on a network because they lack strong integrity controls
    6: An attacker can create a log entry without a timestamp (or no log entry is timestamped)
    7: An attacker can make the logs wrap around and lose data
    8: An attacker can make a log lose or confuse security information
    9: An attacker can use a shared key to authenticate as different principals, confusing the information in the logs
    10: An attacker can get arbitrary data into logs from unauthenticated (or weakly authenticated) outsiders without validation
    J: An attacker can edit logs and there's no way to tell (perhaps because there's no heartbeat option for the logging system)
    Q: An attacker can say "I didn't do that," and you'd have no way to prove them wrong
    K: The system has no logs
    A: You've invented a new Repudiation attack

  Information Disclosure:
    2: An attacker can brute-force file encryption because there's no defense in place (example defense, password stretching)
    3: An attacker can see error messages with security sensitive content
    4: An attacker can read content because messages (say, an email or HTTP cookie) aren't encrypted even if the channel is encrypted
    5: An attacker may be able to read a document or data because it's encrypted with a non-standard algorithm
    6: An attacker can read data because it's hidden or occluded (for undo or change tracking) and the user might forget that it's there
    7: An attacker can act as a 'man in the middle' because you don't authenticate endpoints of a network connection
    8: An attacker can access information through a search indexer, logger, or other such mechanism
    9: An attacker can read sensitive information in a file with bad ACLs
    10: An attacker can read information in files with no ACLs
    J: An attacker can discover the fixed key being used to encrypt
    Q: An attacker can read the entire channel because the channel (say, HTTP or SMTP) isn't encrypted
    K: An attacker can read network information because there's no cryptography used
    A: You've invented a new Information Disclosure attack

  Denial of Service:
    2: An attacker can make your authentication system unusable or unavailable
    3: An attacker can drain our easily replacable battery (battery, temporary)
    4: An attacker can drain a battery that's hard to replace (sealed in a phone, an implanted medical device, or in a hard to reach location) (battery, persist)
    5: An attacker can spend our cloud budget (budget, persist)
    6: An attacker can make a server unavailable or unusable without ever authenticating but the problem goes away when the attacker stops (server, anonymous, temporary)
    7: An attacker can make a client unavailable or unusable and the problem persists after the attacker goes away (client, auth, persist)
    8: An attacker can make a server unavailable or unusable and the problem persists after the attacker goes away (server, auth, persist)
    9: An attacker can make a client unavailable or unusable without ever authenticating and the problem persists after the attacker goes away (client, anon, persist)
    10: An attacker can make a server unavailable or unusable without ever authenticating and the problem persists after the attacker goes away (server, anon, persist)
    J: An attacker can cause the logging subsystem to stop working 
    Q: An attacker can amplify a Denial of Service attack through this component with amplification on the order of 10 to 1
    K: An attacker can amplify a Denial of Service attack through this component with amplification on the order of 100 to 1
    A: You've invented a new Denial of Service attack

  Elevation of Privilege:
    5: An attacker can force data through different validation paths which give different results
    6: An attacker could take advantage of .NET permissions you ask for, but don't use
    7: An attacker can provide a pointer across a trust boundary, rather than data which can be validated
    8: An attacker can enter data that is checked while still under their control and used later on the other side of a trust boundary
    9: There's no reasonable way for a caller to figure out what validation of tainted data you perform before passing it to them
    10: There's no reasonable way for a caller to figure out what security assumptions you make
    J: An attacker can reflect input back to a user, like cross site scripting
    Q: You include user-generated content within your page, possibly including the content of random URLs
    K: An attacker can inject a command that the system will run at a higher privilege level
    A: You've invented a new Elevation of Privilege attack
   
  Privacy:
    2: Your system does not ship by default with optimized, privacy-friendly settings.
    3: Your system is not able to properly handle withdrawal of consent or objection to processing.
    4: Your system collects consent but is not documenting aspects as to how, when, and to what consent was provided.
    5: Personal data in your system is missing pointers to data subjects, hence the data is forgotten when the owner is deleted or makes a request for access.
    6: Your system collects more personal data than strictly necessary to fulfill the intended purpose.
    7: Your system is not following through on personal data deletion in integrated 3rd parties.
    8: Your system is collecting personal data without being able to name the specified, explicit and legitimate purpose it is used for.
    9: Your product team avoids the existing and prescribed controls for personal data by copying personal data out of the regulated and hardened environments.
    10: Your system does not implement erasure or anonymization of personal data once the legal ground for processing has been withdrawn.
    J: Your system is processing personal data in countries or with 3rd parties which have weak privacy standards.
    Q: Your system is processing personal data in a way that is not described in the privacy notice or is unexpected to the data subjects.
    K: Your system reuses personal data collected for a specific purpose for a non-compatible other purpose.
    A: You've invented a new Privacy violation.
